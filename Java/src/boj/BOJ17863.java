         * Î¨∏Ï†ú:
         * In the United States of America, telephone numbers within an area code consist of 7 digits:
         * the prefix number is the first 3 digits and the line number is the last 4 digits.
         * Traditionally, the 555 prefix number has been used to provide directory information and
         * assistance as in the following examples:
         * 
         *   - 555-1212
         *   - 555-9876
         *   - 555-5000
         *   - 555-7777
         * 
         * Telephone company switching hardware would detect the 555 prefix and route the call to a
         * directory information operator. Now-a-days, telephone switching is done digitally and
         * somewhere along the line a computer decides where to route calls.
         * 
         * For this problem, write a program that determines if a supplied 7-digit telephone number
         * should be routed to the directory information operator, that is, the prefix number is 555.
         * 
         * ÏûÖÎ†•:
         * The input consists of a single line containing a 7-digit positive integer N,
         * (1000000 <= N <= 9999999).
         * 
         * Ï∂úÎ†•:
         * The single output line consists of the word YES if the number should be routed to the
         * directory information operator or NO if the number should not be routed to the
         * directory information operator.
