         * Î¨∏Ï†ú:
         * Now that Snapchat and Slingshot are soooo 2018,
         * the teenagers of the world have all switched to the new hot app called BAPC
         * (Bidirectional and Private Communication).
         * This app has some stricter social rules than previous iterations.
         * 
         * For example, if someone says goodbye using "Later!", the other person is
         * expected to reply with "Alligator!".
         * 
         * You can not keep track of all these social conventions and decide to automate
         * any necessary responses,
         * starting with the most important one: the greetings.
         * 
         * When your conversational partner opens with "he...ey", you have to respond
         * with "hee...eey" as well,
         * but using twice as many 'e's!
         * 
         * Given a string of the form "he...ey" of length at most 1000,
         * print the greeting you will respond with, containing twice as many 'e's.
         * 
         * ÏûÖÎ†•:
         * The input consists of one line containing a single string s as specified,
         * of length at least 3 and at most 1000.
         * 
         * Ï∂úÎ†•:
         * Output the required response.
