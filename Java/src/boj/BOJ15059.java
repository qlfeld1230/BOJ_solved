         * Î¨∏Ï†ú:
         * In long flights, airlines offer hot meals. Usually the flight attendants push carts
         * containing the meals down along the aisles of the plane. When a cart reaches your row,
         * you are asked right away: ‚ÄúChicken, beef, or pasta?‚Äù You know your choices, but you
         * have only a few seconds to choose and you don‚Äôt know how your choice will look like
         * because your neighbor hasn‚Äôt opened his wrap yet...
         * 
         * The flight attendant in this flight decided to change the procedure. First she will
         * ask all passengers what choice of meal they would prefer, and then she will check
         * if the number of meals available in this flight for each choice are enough.
         * 
         * As an example, consider that the available number of meals for chicken, beef and
         * pasta are respectively (80, 20, 40), while the number of passenger‚Äôs choices for
         * chicken, beef and pasta are respectively (45, 23, 48). In this case, eleven people
         * will surely not receive their selection for a meal, since three passengers who wanted
         * beef and eight passengers who wanted pasta cannot be pleased.
         * 
         * Given the quantity of meals available for each choice and the number of meals requested
         * for each choice, could you please help the flight attendant to determine how many
         * passengers will surely not receive their selection for a meal?
         * 
         * ÏûÖÎ†•:
         * The first line contains three integers C‚Çê, B‚Çê and P‚Çê (0 ‚â§ C‚Çê, B‚Çê, P‚Çê ‚â§ 100),
         * representing respectively the number of meals available for chicken, beef and pasta.
         * 
         * The second line contains three integers C·µ£, B·µ£ and P·µ£ (0 ‚â§ C·µ£, B·µ£, P·µ£ ‚â§ 100),
         * indicating respectively the number of meals requested for chicken, beef and pasta.
         * 
         * Ï∂úÎ†•:
         * Output a single line with an integer representing the number of passengers that will
         * surely not receive their selection for a meal.
